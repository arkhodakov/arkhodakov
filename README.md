# Hello, I'm Artem :wave:

I'm a software engineer who is enthusiastic about solving valuable business tasks. I enjoy working with machine learning technologies, especially computer vision technologies, developing software for collecting data about the world around me. I spend time studying ways of analysis of such data in order to make my projects not only collecting data but processing in and making decisions out of it.

_Note: Top Languages shows usage of specific languages in my projects, not my skills._
